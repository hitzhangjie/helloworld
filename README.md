# helloworld

This project aims to create a platform that empowers developers, particularly solo developers and small teams, to accelerate their application development lifecycle. The goal is to provide a comprehensive infrastructure that streamlines the process of developing, building, testing, and delivering applications, enabling developers to quickly validate their ideas and achieve market success.

The platform will leverage expertise in the `trpc-go` microservice framework and distributed system development. While `trpc-go` offers a powerful and pluggable foundation, the project will also explore and potentially integrate technologies like `dapr` to further enhance its capabilities.

By providing a robust and efficient development ecosystem, `helloworld` seeks to help developers focus on innovation and bring their applications to life faster than ever before.
